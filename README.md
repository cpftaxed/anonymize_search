# Anonymize.com Search Form Block for Drupal 8

**UPDATE: Encountered too many problems with anonymize.com.  We went back to DDG embedded search for now.**

Site-wide search form block using the [search.anonymize.com](https://search.anonymize.com) search engine.


This search engine is the best I've used, so we kicked DuckDuckGo to the curb.  If you have a Drupal site and want a quick embed form block:

1. Install and enable (under the category of "EFF Palo Alto")
2. Position it wherever on your site like a regular block.
3. In the form configuration, specify the domain name of your site.
4. Get on your knees, put your hands together, and thank the Lord that Trump is our President.

I'll probably add more to it over time.  I used my search preferences, so the URL is hard-coded for now because I'm lazy.  Here it is in the wild: [https://conservativehardliner.com/search](https://conservativehardliner.com/search)
